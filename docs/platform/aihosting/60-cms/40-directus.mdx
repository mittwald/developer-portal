## Using mittwald AI Hosting with Directus

[Directus v11.15](https://github.com/directus/directus/releases/tag/v11.15.0) and later includes built-in AI assistant capabilities with support for OpenAI-compatible providers. Since mittwald AI Hosting provides an OpenAI-compatible API, you can use it directly with Directus without installing any additional extensions.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you are running Directus version 11.15.0 or later, as this version introduced multi-provider AI support including OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

If you don't have an API key yet, follow the [mittwald AI Hosting access guide](../access-and-usage/access) to generate one through your mStudio dashboard.

### Configuration

The AI assistant in Directus is configured through the admin settings interface. Navigate to **Settings** → **AI** in your Directus admin panel to access the [OpenAI-compatible provider configuration](https://directus.io/docs/guides/ai/assistant/setup#openai-compatible-providers).

#### Step 1: Configure the provider

In the AI settings, configure the OpenAI-compatible provider with the following values:

- **Base URL**: Enter `https://llm.aihosting.mittwald.de/v1`
- **API Key**: Enter your mittwald AI Hosting API key
- **Model**: Enter the model identifier you want to use, such as `ministral-3-14b-instruct-2512`

The system automatically appends `/chat/completions` to the base URL when making requests, so do not include this path segment in the base URL field.

#### Step 2: Enable the AI assistant

After configuring the provider, ensure the AI assistant is enabled. If AI features are disabled at the system level through the `AI_ENABLED` environment variable, the AI assistant sidebar will be hidden and the settings form will display a disabled notice.

### Available models

You can use any chat-capable model from mittwald AI Hosting with Directus. Recommended models include:

- `ministral-3-14b-instruct-2512` — General-purpose model with vision support
- `devstral-small-2-24b-instruct-2512` — Optimized for code-related tasks
- `gpt-oss-120b` — Large model for complex reasoning tasks

For a complete list of available models and their capabilities, see the [models overview](../models/).

### Usage limits

The mittwald AI Hosting service has usage limits based on your account tier. For details on rate limits and quotas, refer to the [terms of use](../access-and-usage/terms-of-use).
