If the API returns a status code outside the 200 to 399 range, there is an error in the request. The following errors are expected:

- `401 Unauthorized`: No API key was provided in the `Authorization` header, or the API key is invalid.
- `429 Too Many Requests`: The rate limit has been reached. No further requests can be made within the current minute. The limit resets after the minute has passed.
- `400 Bad Request`: The request cannot be processed. An error message should be included explaining the reasons:
  - `At most n image(s) may be provided in one request.`: The total number of images in the provided context exceeds the model's capacity. Either remove images from the context or start a new context.
  - `max_tokens must be at least…`: The maximum context length of the model was exceeded for text generation. The error message also shows the number of excess tokens (as a negative value). The context must be shortened.
