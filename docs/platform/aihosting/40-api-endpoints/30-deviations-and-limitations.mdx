## Deviations from the OpenAI API

Although our API is compatible with the OpenAI API, there are some limitations:

- Only selected endpoints are implemented (see [list](../supported-endpoints/))
- Some parameters like `n`, `logprobs`, `functions` (depending on the model) are not available
- Vision input is currently only supported via Base64, not via URLs

## Limitations

All requests are subject to a rate limit to ensure fair and consistent usage and availability of the models for all users. During the beta phase, this is set at 300 requests per minute per API key, regardless of the model used. If the limit is exceeded, the user will receive an HTTP status code `429 Too Many Requests`. After one minute, the limit resets for the used API key.

All models are also subject to model-specific limitations. These always include the allowed context length measured in the number of transmitted tokens. For vision-capable models that process images, only a limited number of images can be transmitted per request, meaning _across the entire submitted context_. This affects all images sent in the full chat history of a request.

Currently, it is **not possible to generate images**. A corresponding API route does not exist.
