## Description

"gpt-oss-120b" is a 117-billion-parameter open reasoning model designed for agentic intelligence, adaptive decision-making, and multi-step problem solving. It integrates structured reasoning with dynamic tool orchestration, enabling autonomous agents to plan, evaluate, and act across complex real-world contexts. Fine-tuned on diverse analytical and interaction-rich datasets, it maintains coherence over long reasoning chains, balances exploration with precision, and delivers transparent, goal-directed thought processes suited for research, operational, and strategic domains.

The following limitations apply:

- Maximum context length: 131.072 tokens
- "built-in tools" like web browsing not supported for security reasons. Standard tool-calling remains available.

Recommended inference parameters:

- `temperature=1.0`
- `top_p=1`

You can adjust the reasoning effort done by this model by defining it inside your system prompt in the following way: "Reasoning: high". You have three options:

- `high`: Deep and detailed analysis
- `medium`: Balanced speed and detail
- `low`: Fast responses for general dialogue
