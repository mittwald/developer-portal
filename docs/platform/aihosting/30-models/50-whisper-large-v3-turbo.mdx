## Description

“Whisper-Large-V3-Turbo” is a multilingual automatic speech recognition model (ASR) developed by OpenAI, optimized for speed and efficiency. It is based on the architecture of the well-known “Whisper-Large-V3” model, but uses a lighter decoder structure to significantly reduce latency with only a minimal loss in accuracy. The model supports over 99 languages and is ideal for transcribing speech inputs.

The following limitations apply to this model on our platform:
- Maximum file size: 25 MB per upload
- No explicit context length limit – depends on audio duration and file size
- Translation is currently not supported (`to_language`)
- Supported output formats: **`text`**, **`json`**
    - Other formats (`srt`, `vtt`, `verbose_json`) are currently not supported

### Supported Input Formats

`mp3`, `ogg`, `wav`, `flac`

## Supported values for parameter `language` (ISO-639-1 language codes)

`af`, `ar`, `az`, `be`, `bg`, `bs`, `ca`, `cs`, `cy`, `da`, `de`, `el`, `en`, `es`, `et`, `fa`, `fi`, `fr`, `gl`, `he`, `hi`, `hr`, `hu`, `hy`, `id`, `is`, `it`, `ja`, `kk`, `kn`, `ko`, `lt`, `lv`, `mk`, `mi`, `mr`, `ms`, `ne`, `nl`, `no`, `pl`, `pt`, `ro`, `ru`, `sk`, `sl`, `sr`, `sv`, `sw`, `ta`, `th`, `tl`, `tr`, `uk`, `ur`, `vi`, `zh`

### Recommended Inference Parameters

- `temperature=1.0`
- `top_p=1.0`
- `response_format="json"`
- **`language` like `language="de"`should always be set explicitly** to maximize accuracy.
  If no value is provided, **German (`"de"`)** will be assumed by default, which may result in poorer outcomes for inputs in other languages.

### Example Output (`response_format=json`)

```json
{
  "text": "This is the transcribed text of a speech input.",
  "usage": {
    "type": "duration",
    "seconds": 8
  }
}
```

### Best Practices

- **Always set the `language` parameter explicitly**, e.g. `language="de"` for German audio files.
- Segment long audio files into chunks of < 25 MB.
- For real-time or near-real-time applications, use `response_format="text"`.
- For multilingual recordings: transcribe each language separately for better accuracy.
