mittwald's AI hosting is designed for agencies, freelancers, and their end customers. It is suitable for:

- Agencies looking to integrate LLMs into client projects,
- Developers of SaaS products with AI components,
- Users who want to replace international providers like OpenAI in their AI applications,
- Privacy-conscious or data-sensitive organizations requiring a fully EU-based hosting infrastructure.

Various Large Language Models (LLMs) can be integrated into your applications via an OpenAI-compatible API and used in a wide range of AI scenarios. These use cases include, for example:

- **Text generation** or the implementation of a **chat bot**
- **Image processing**, such as generating image descriptions or alternative texts
- Building a **RAG system** using our container hosting to create a custom, AI-powered knowledge base
- **AI agents** that can autonomously handle complex tasks using tool-calling or as MCP servers

On the following subpages, we explain how to obtain an API key, use the available models, and explore example applications.
