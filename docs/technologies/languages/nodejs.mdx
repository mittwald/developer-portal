## Starting a Node.JS application

### Via the mStudio UI

To start a Node.JS application from the mStudio, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project that you want to create the application in.
2. Select the "Apps" menu item in the sidebar.
3. Click the "Create App" button and select "Custom Node.JS app".
4. In the installation wizard, select the entrypoint command that should be used
   to start your application and complete the wizard.

### Via the API

To learn how to deploy a Node.JS application via the API, read the article
["Starting a Node.JS application"](../../api/howtos/create-nodejs).

### Deploying your app

After you have created your Node.JS app, you can deploy your code by moving it
into the designated application directory. You may use any method that you
prefer to deploy your code, such as a local Git clone, rsync or SFTP.

:::info

Since the deployment of your application is optimized for production usage, the
platform will **NOT** automatically restart your application on code changes.
You will need to restart your application manually after you have deployed your
code. See the section on
[managing your process lifecycle](#managing-your-process-lifecycle) for more
information.

## Making your app accessible via HTTP

After you have created your Node.JS app, you can make it accessible via HTTP.
Our platform will make sure that the process that you have configured in the
previous step will be running at all times.

:::info

There is a possibility that your application will not immediately start when you
have created your application _before_ deploying any code. In this case, our
automation will attempt to start your process for a certain number of times and
then back off. When connected to a shell in your hosting environment, you can
use the `mittnitectl job status` command to inspect your process status, and
then `mittnitectl job start` to start your process. See the section on
[managing your process lifecycle](#managing-your-process-lifecycle) for more
information.

:::

You can connect your application to the internet by linking it to a domain via
the mStudio or the API. Our platform will take care of routing any traffic to
that domain to your application, and will also handle TLS termination, if you
have configured a certificate.

Your Node.JS application simply needs to listen for plain HTTP traffic on a port
that should be read from the `PORT` environment variable.

:::caution

Please **DO NOT** make any assumptions about the port that your application
should listen on. The port that your application should listen on is provided
via the `PORT` environment variable, and may change at any time.

## Managing your process lifecycle

With a Node.JS application, the entire lifecycle of your process is managed
within the application itself. Within your hosting environment, your Node.JS
process is managed by the
[mittnite init system](https://github.com/mittwald/mittnite), a lightweight
process manager that is responsible for starting, stopping and restarting your
application.

Within your hosting environment, you can use the `mittnitectl` command to manage
your application:

- `mittnitectl start` starts your application
- `mittnitectl stop` stops your application
- `mittnitectl restart` restarts your application

You can also use `mittnitectl` to view the status of your application:

- `mittnitectl status` shows the status of your application
- `mittnitectl logs` shows the logs of your application
