# Tutorials

Tutorials are guided learning paths: you provide intent, the agent executes via MCP tools, and you verify outcomes.

Every tutorial in this section follows the same structure:

1. Copy/paste starter prompt
2. What the agent does automatically
3. What you still must do
4. Likely questions and good answers
5. Verification prompt
6. Rollback/cleanup prompt
7. Resume-after-failure prompt
