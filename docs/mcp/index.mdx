# Introduction to the mStudio MCP server

mittwald MCP lets you manage your hosting infrastructure through AI assistants like Claude, Copilot, or ChatGPT using natural language.

## Quick Start {#quick-start}

Connect your AI tool to the mittwald MCP server:

```
https://mcp.mittwald.de/mcp
```

Choose your tool and follow the setup guide:

| Tool                                                     | Type            | Setup Time |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------- |
| **[Claude Desktop](./getting-connected/claude-desktop)** | Desktop/Web App | ~5 min     |
| **[ChatGPT](./getting-connected/chatgpt)**               | Web/Mobile App  | ~5 min     |
| **[Claude Code](./getting-connected/claude-code)**       | CLI             | ~10 min    |
| **[GitHub Copilot](./getting-connected/github-copilot)** | IDE Extension   | ~10 min    |
| **[Cursor](./getting-connected/cursor)**                 | IDE             | ~10 min    |
| **[Codex CLI](./getting-connected/codex-cli)**           | CLI             | ~10 min    |

Once connected, try a simple command in your AI tool:

```
Use mittwald MCP to list my projects
```

## What is MCP? {#what-is-mcp}

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is an open standard that connects AI assistants to external services. Instead of building separate integrations for each AI tool, mittwald provides one MCP server that works with all MCP-compatible clients.

Your AI assistant sends requests to the mittwald MCP server, which translates them into API calls and returns results. You interact in natural language; the protocol handles the rest.

## Agentic Coding: AI That Takes Action {#agentic-coding}

Traditional AI assistants suggest what to do. Agentic AI **executes** it.

Instead of receiving API documentation to copy-paste, you describe your goal:

> "Create a project with WordPress, MySQL database, and daily backups"

The agent determines which tools to call, handles authentication, executes the steps in sequence, and reports the result. Multi-step workflows that previously required manual coordination happen automatically.

Agents have guardrails: destructive operations require confirmation, and you maintain oversight of what actions are taken.

## Authentication {#authentication}

mittwald MCP uses OAuth 2.1 with PKCE for authentication. When you connect a tool:

1. You authenticate directly with mittwald in your browser
2. You approve specific permissions for the tool
3. mittwald issues a temporary token to the tool
4. The tool uses this token—never your password

Tokens are scoped to specific permissions, expire automatically, and can be revoked anytime. Your credentials stay with mittwald.

For CI/CD pipelines or headless environments, you can also use [API tokens](./getting-connected/#option-2-api-token) instead of OAuth.
