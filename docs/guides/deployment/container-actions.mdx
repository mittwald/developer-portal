Using GitHub Actions you can build and publish your container image right from your source code repository, and then immediately deploy your application on the mittwald cloud platform. The official **`mittwald/deploy-container-action`** takes care of the API calls, applies your stack definition, and (if necessary) re-creates the affected services.

## Prerequisites

- **mStudio API token**; see the docs on [obtaining an API token](/docs/v2/api/intro#obtaining-an-api-token)
- **Stack ID**; see the docs on [identifying the default stack](/docs/v2/api/howtos/create-container/#identify-default-stack)
- **(Optional) Private registry**; see [_Using private registries_](/docs/v2/platform/workloads/containers/#private-registries)
- **GitHub Actions runner**; any runner with Docker support, e.g. `ubuntu-latest`

## Identify your stack

Follow the documentation on [identifying the default stack](/docs/v2/api/howtos/create-container/#identify-default-stack) of your project. For convenience, we recommend storing the stack ID in a GitHub [variable](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/store-information-in-variables) or (when you're deploying into multiple environments) using a GitHub [environment secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/deploy/configure-and-manage-deployments/manage-environments), e.g. **`STACK_ID`**.

## Write your `stack.yaml`

Next, create a file containing your stack definition somewhere in your repository (for this example, we'll assume `deploy/stack.yaml`). This file should follow the same format as the <OperationLink operation="container-declare-stack" apiVersion="v2" /> operation.

```yaml title="deploy/stack.yaml"
services:
  app:
    image: "{{ .Env.IMAGE_TAG }}"
    description: "My web app"
    ports:
      - "8080/tcp"
    environment:
      APP_ENV: production
volumes: {}
```

The placeholders inside `{{ … }}` are resolved from environment variables you pass in the workflow, so your secrets stay in GitHub and never touch the repo.

## Add secrets and variable to the repo

- **`MITTWALD_API_TOKEN`**; API token from mStudio
- **`STACK_ID`**; the ID copied in step 1. You could set this as a simple configuration variable, but might also attach this variable [to your target environment](https://docs.github.com/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#vars-context), if you want to deploy into multiple stacks, depending on your environment.

## Create the GitHub Action workflow

Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Build & Deploy to mittwald

on:
  push:
    tags: [v*]
  # alternatively:
  # push:
  #   branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    permissions:
      contents: read
      packages: write
      attestations: write
      id-token: write

    environment:
      name: production
      url: https://your-app.example

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3

      - name: Log in to GHCR
        uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          registry: ghcr.io
          username: ${{ github.actor }}
          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Extract metadata (tags, labels) for Docker
        id: meta
        uses: docker/metadata-action@v5
        with:
          images: ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}
          tags: |
            type=semver,pattern={{version}}
            type=semver,pattern={{major}}.{{minor}}

      - name: Build & push
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
        with:
          context: .
          push: true
          tags: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.tags }}
          labels: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.labels }}
          cache-from: type=gha
          cache-to: type=gha,mode=max

      - name: Deploy to mStudio
        uses: mittwald/deploy-container-action@v1
        env:
          IMAGE_TAG: ${{ fromJSON(steps.meta.outputs.json).tags[0] }}
        with:
          api_token: ${{ secrets.MITTWALD_API_TOKEN }}
          stack_id: ${{ vars.STACK_ID }}
          stack_file: "${{ github.workspace }}/configs/stack.yaml"
```

Using this workflow, on every push of a new Git tag (or on any push to the `main` branch, depending on which configuration you choose), GitHub will build a new image, push it to GitHub Container Registry and instruct mStudio to run it.

## Advanced patterns

### Selective restarts

If you need to avoid downtime for stateful services (e.g. databases) you can tell the Action to **skip** recreation after the update:

```yaml
with:
  skip_recreation: "mysql,redis"
```

Services not listed are only restarted when the API reports that a restart is actually required.

### Next steps

- Add an [Ingress](/docs/v2/platform/workloads/containers/#ingress-http) to expose HTTP ports to the public internet.
- Use [Terraform](/docs/v2/guides/deployment/terraform/) for fully-declarative infra, then let GitHub Actions call `terraform apply`.
- Define environments dynamically per pull request to spin up short-lived review environments for each PR.
