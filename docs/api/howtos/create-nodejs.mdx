## Prerequisites

To install a Node.js application, you will need to have the following:

- The project ID of an existing project ([how to create a project](./create-project))
- The application and version ID of the generic custom Node.js application (see next section)

## Determine the app and app version ID

Before installing a Node.js application, you will need to determine the application ID and version ID of the generic custom Node.js application.

For this, call the `/v2/apps` endpoint, and find the "Node.js" application. It should have a stable ID of `3e7f920b-a711-4d2f-9871-661e1b41a2f0`. You can then use that ID to retrieve the recommended version to install for this app, by calling the `/v2/apps/{appID}/versions` endpoint. You can filter the returned versions by the `recommended` property.

Please note that the actual version is rather inconsequential, as it refers only to the starter template used to create the application. The actual version of the application will be determined by your own code.

## Install the application

To deploy your application, you will need to call the `POST /v2/projects/{projectID}/appinstallations` endpoint. The relevant fields are the following:

- `appVersionId` needs to be the app version ID that you retrieved in the previous step.
- `userInputs` needs to be an array of objects, each containing a `name` and `value` property. The allowed values for `name` are contained in the `userInputs` array of the app version object. In the case of Node.js, the only allowed value is `entrypoint`, which is the command that will be run to start your application.
- `updatePolicy` needs to be set to `none`, as you will typically want to update your application by yourself.

The complete HTTP request should look like this:

```http request
POST /v2/project/{projectID}/appinstallations HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "appVersionId": "97fb8684-3fe3-4720-86fb-fb0524ae88d1",
  "description": "Your Node.js app",
  "updatePolicy": "none",
  "userInputs": [{
    "name": "entrypoint",
    "value": "yarn start"
  }]
}
```

The response will contain the installation ID, that you can subsequently use to access your application.

To observe the installation status, you can call the `/v2/appinstallations/{installationID}` endpoint. Pay special attention to the `installationPath` field; this will contain the directory in your project file system that you should deploy your application to.
