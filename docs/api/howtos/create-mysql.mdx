This article describes how to create a MySQL database via the API.

## Prerequisites

To create a MySQL database, you will need to have access to a project. Refer to the [guide "create a project"](../create-project) for this. You will need the **project ID** for the subsequent operations.

## List available MySQL versions {#list-available-mysql-versions}

Send a request to the <OperationLink operation="database-list-mysql-versions" /> endpoint to get a list of available MySQL versions.

Each returned version object contains the following properties:

- `id` contains the unique identifier of the version
- `number` contains the version number (e.g., "8.0")
- `name` contains a human-readable name for the version
- `disabled` indicates whether the version is available for use

**Important:** When selecting a version for your database, you must choose a version where `disabled` is `false`.

## Creating a MySQL database {#creating-mysql-database}

To create a MySQL database, send a request to the <OperationLink operation="database-create-mysql-database" /> endpoint. The request body must contain a JSON object with the following properties:

### Database properties

- `database.description` should contain a human-readable description of the database. This is a required value.
- `database.version` should contain the **version number** of the database (e.g., "8.0"). This is a required value, and must match the `number` property of a version returned by the <OperationLink operation="database-list-mysql-versions" /> endpoint (not the `id` property).
- `database.characterSettings` (optional) allows you to specify the character set and collation for the database.

### User properties

When creating a MySQL database, you must also create an initial user. The user properties include:

- `user.password` should contain the password for the database user. This is a required value.
- `user.accessLevel` must be set to `"full"` for the initial user. This is a required value.
- `user.externalAccess` (optional) indicates whether the user can access the database from outside the hosting environment.
- `user.accessIpMask` (optional) specifies IP address restrictions for external access.

<OperationExample
  operation="database-create-mysql-database"
  pathParameters={{ projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID" }}
  example={{
    database: {
      description: "My Application Database",
      version: "8.0",
    },
    user: {
      password: "your-secure-password",
      accessLevel: "full",
    },
  }}
/>

The response will contain the following properties:

- `id` contains the ID of the created database.
- `userId` contains the ID of the created user.

<OperationHint tag="Database" operation="database-create-mysql-database" />

## Monitoring database readiness {#monitoring-database-readiness}

After creating a database, it may take a few moments before it is ready to use. You can monitor the readiness status by sending a request to the <OperationLink operation="database-get-mysql-database" /> endpoint.

The response contains a `mainUser` object with a `status` field. This field can have the following values:

- `pending` - The user is being created
- `ready` - The user is ready and the database can be used
- `error` - An error occurred during user creation
- `terminating` - The user is being deleted
- `disabled` - The user has been disabled

**Important:** Wait until the `mainUser.status` field is `"ready"` before attempting to connect to the database.

## Accessing the database {#accessing-database}

Once the database is ready, you can retrieve connection information by sending a request to the <OperationLink operation="database-get-mysql-database" /> endpoint.

Among others, the response will contain the following values:

- `hostname` contains the hostname of the database server. You can use this value to connect to the database from within your hosting environment.
- `name` contains the name of the database.
- `mainUser.name` contains the username for database authentication.
- `characterSettings` allows you to inspect the character set and collation settings applied to your database.

**Note:** The password is set during database creation and cannot be retrieved via the API. To change the password, use the <OperationLink operation="database-update-mysql-user-password" /> endpoint.

<OperationHint tag="Database" operation="database-get-mysql-database" />
