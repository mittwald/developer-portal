title: Pricing Variants of an Extension
---

## Concept of Pricing Variants

Extensions in mStudio can be offered with different pricing models.  
A contributor can decide whether an extension is:

- **Free of charge**  
- Has a **single fixed price**  
- Or offers **multiple pricing variants**  

A pricing variant allows offering different **feature scopes** of an extension at different prices.

Each variant consists of the following properties:

| Property | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Name** | Display name of the variant (e.g., “Basic”, “Pro”, “Enterprise”) |
| **Price** | Monthly price charged to the customer |
| **Features** | Description of the scope of features for the variant. This is more specific than the general extension description |
| **variantKey** | Technical key of the variant (must be unique and cannot be changed after creation) |

When customers install an extension, they can select one of the available variants.  
The selected variant determines both the price and the available functionality.

## Managing Pricing Variants in mStudio

Pricing variants are configured in the **Extension Management** area of mStudio:

Organization -> Contribution -> Development -> Select or create Extension -> Details -> Pricing Details

In the **Pricing Details** section, contributors can:

1. **Create new variants** by providing the following details:
   - A **name**
   - A **price**
   - **Features**
   - A unique **variantKey**

2. **Edit existing variants**, provided the extension is **not within the 30-day lock period after publication** (see below).

### Rules for Variant Management

- The **variantKey** is assigned by the contributor and uniquely identifies a variant **within an extension**.  
- After initial creation, the **variantKey cannot be changed**.  
- If the extension previously had a single price, the **first created price** can be reused as a variant with the **"default" key**.

### User Interface Behavior

The mStudio interface provides separate input fields for each variant property.  
The system automatically checks for unique `variantKey`s and names.  
Only one free variant can exist.  
If applicable, the contributor can indicate whether a change represents a **feature change**.

---

## Restrictions After Publication

After an extension has been published, any modification of pricing data triggers a **30-day lock period** during which changes to prices or variants are not allowed.

This lock includes:

- Adding new variants  
- Modifying **name**, **features**, or **price** of existing variants  
- Switching between **free**, **single price**, or **pricing variants**  
- Changing the single price  

After the 30 days have passed, changes can be made again.  
If a change affects the **feature scope**, it must be explicitly marked in mStudio.

---

## Effects on Existing Installations

When changes to prices or feature scopes are made, the system ensures that existing customers are notified and must **accept** or **reject** the new conditions.

### Customer interaction is required when:

- An extension changes from **free → single price** or **free → variants**  
- A **single price** changes  
- The user’s selected **variant** (price or feature scope) changes  

### Process

1. The affected customer receives a **notification in mStudio** as well as an **email**.  
2. A notice is displayed on the extension’s detail page and in the instance list, prompting the customer to take action.  
3. The customer must respond within **30 days**.  
4. If no action is taken within this period, the corresponding **extension instance is automatically deleted**.

Contributors are informed about these events via **Lifecycle Webhooks**.

---

## Technical Integration

Each extension receives notifications from mStudio via the [**Lifecycle Webhooks**](https://developer.mittwald.de/docs/v2/contribution/reference/webhooks/).  
These webhook payloads include the `variantKey` to identify which variant a customer has selected.

> **Important:**  
> The `variantKey` is the technical reference for variant management.  
> It must be mapped uniquely to the corresponding variant in the contributor’s backend.

### Access via the Extension Bridge

During an active session in mStudio, an extension can access the selected variant via the **Extension Bridge and current session**: [Session Handling](https://developer.mittwald.de/docs/v2/contribution/how-to/develop-frontend-fragment/#session-handling-and-configuration-values-via-ext-bridge)

This allows the extension’s frontend to dynamically adjust its display or functionality based on the selected variant.

---

## Contributor Responsibilities

Contributors are responsible for:

- Creating and maintaining their variants in mStudio
- Correctly processing the variantKey in their backend
- Handling the Lifecycle Webhooks
- Mapping the selected variant in their functional or billing system
- Adhering to the 30-day lock period after a pricing change

---

## Best Practices
- Use descriptive keys for variants (e.g., basic, pro, enterprise).
- Clearly describe the feature scope of each variant.
- Log all events related to variant changes internally.
- Thoroughly test all variant transitions before publication.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Possible Cause | Solution |
|----------|------------------|--------|
| Variant not recognized in backend | Missing or incorrect `variantKey` | Process webhook payload correctly and verify mapping |
| Changes not possible | 30-day lock period active | Wait until the lock period expires |
| Customer loses access to extension | No response to pricing change within 30 days | Extension instance was automatically deleted |
| Incorrect feature scope active | Variant not correctly processed in business logic | Check `variantKey` mapping in backend |

---

## Summary

Pricing variants enable flexible monetization of extensions in mStudio.
By following the described processes and lifecycle requirements, contributors can safely and transparently offer their extensions with different pricing and feature levels.
Proper webhook handling and consistent variant management are essential for accurate billing and a seamless customer experience.
