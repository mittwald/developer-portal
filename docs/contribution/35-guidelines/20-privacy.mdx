title: Privacy and GDPR Policy for Extensions in the mStudio marketplace
sidebar_label: Privacy policy
---

This privacy and GDPR policy establishes the requirements that contributors must follow to ensure compliance with data protection regulations, including GDPR, when developing and distributing extensions in the mStudio Marketplace. The goal is to protect user privacy and maintain transparency in data handling.

## Data Deletion Policy

### Deletion of Data on Uninstallation

When a user uninstalls an _Extension Instance_, any data stored or processed by the extension related to that extension instance must be securely deleted. This includes:

- User-generated data stored locally or remotely by the extension.
- Logs or backups created by the extension during its operation.

Extensions must ensure no residual data remains after uninstallation unless explicitly requested and approved by the user.

### Secure Deletion Practices

All data deletion processes must ensure that the data is irretrievably removed, preventing any unauthorized recovery or misuse. Contributors should:

- Use secure deletion protocols for locally stored data.
- Ensure remote data deletion complies with server-side security standards, such as GDPR Article 17 ("Right to Erasure").
- Verify and log the successful deletion of data where feasible.

## Data Minimization

### Collect Only Necessary Data

Extensions must collect only the data strictly necessary for their functionality. Special attention must be given when processing personal data:

- Avoid collecting sensitive personal data unless absolutely necessary.
- Implement clear documentation and safeguards for all collected data.

Contributors are responsible for ensuring that data minimization principles are integrated into their extension’s design and operation.

### Justification for Data Collection

For every data point collected, contributors must:

- Clearly define the purpose of the collection.
- Document why the data is essential to the extension's functionality.
- Ensure that the collected data does not exceed what is necessary for the stated purpose.

This documentation should be available for audits and user inquiries to demonstrate compliance.

## Data Processing Agreements

### Agreements with Third-Party Services

If the extension relies on third-party services for data processing, contributors must ensure that:

- Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) are in place with all third-party providers.
- The agreements comply with GDPR and include provisions for secure processing and storage of data.
- The third parties adhere to GDPR-compliant practices.

Contributors must document and maintain these agreements as part of their responsibility.

### Regular Review of Third-Party Compliance

Contributors must periodically review the compliance of third-party services to ensure:

- They are up to date with relevant data protection regulations.
- They have not introduced new risks or vulnerabilities.
- Any changes to their terms of service or practices are consistent with GDPR requirements.

This proactive approach minimizes the risk of non-compliance due to third-party failures.

## Transparency in Data Processing

### Inform Users About Data Usage

Extensions must provide clear and detailed information to users about any personal data being processed. This includes:

- A list of personal data collected and processed.
- The purpose of data collection.
- Where and how the data is stored.
- Details of third-party services involved in processing, if any.

This information must be easily accessible to users and included in the extension’s documentation or settings.

### User Consent and Control

Extensions must ensure that users:

- Provide explicit consent before any personal data is collected or processed.
- Have the ability to review, modify, or delete their data easily.
- Can withdraw consent at any time without affecting the core functionality of the extension, unless such functionality relies on the specific data.

The process for obtaining consent and enabling user control must be straightforward and user-friendly.

## Incident Response

In the event of a data breach or violation of GDPR requirements:

- The incident must be reported immediately to mittwald, the marketplace operator.
- Affected users must also be informed promptly about the breach, the scope of the impact, and any measures taken to mitigate the issue.

Contributors must have a clear protocol for identifying, documenting, and addressing data breaches to minimize harm and ensure compliance.

## Consequences of Non-Compliance

Extensions that violate this privacy and GDPR policy:

- Will be removed from the marketplace.
- May result in the contributor’s account being banned.
- Could lead to legal action or regulatory penalties, especially in cases of intentional or negligent data handling practices.

By adhering to this policy, contributors help create a privacy-focused environment in the mStudio Marketplace, ensuring compliance with GDPR and fostering trust among users.
