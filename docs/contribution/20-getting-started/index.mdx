# Getting Started with Extension Development

Welcome to the getting started guide for building mittwald Extensions.

## What Is an Extension?

An **Extension** is a web application that adds functionality to mStudio.
Extensions are developed by Contributors and provided in the mStudio marketplace, either for your own organization only or publicly.

Technically, a classic Extension consists of:

- **Backend** - your server application
- **Frontend Fragment** - UI components rendered inside mStudio
- **Database** - for persisting Extension data

Extensions communicate with mStudio through the mittwald API and can access project or organization data.

## What You Will Learn in This Guide

In this guide, you will learn how to:

- set up a complete Extension development environment
- use the Reference Extension as a foundation for your own Extension
- develop and test your Extension locally
- deploy and publish an Extension in mStudio
- adapt the Reference Extension to your own requirements and ideas

The Reference Extension used in this guide demonstrates how to:

- interact with the mittwald API
- persist custom data in a database
- use flow Remote Components

Because the marketplace supports different kinds of Extensions, this guide uses a representative example: an Extension that integrates a [Frontend Fragment](../overview/concepts/frontend-development#frontend-fragments) into mStudio. Other approaches are not covered in full detail.

A more extensive explanation of External Frontends is available in the [Next Steps](./next-steps/external-frontend).

## Prerequisites

In principle, you can build Extensions with almost any web technology.
Based on Contributor experience and existing libraries, however, some technologies and frameworks have proven especially suitable.

To follow this guide smoothly and build your own Extension on top of it,
make sure you meet the following prerequisites.

### Technical Requirements

#### Software

You need the following software on your development machine:

##### Node.js

- **Version:** 22.x or higher
- **Check:**

```bash
node --version
# Should return v22.x.x or higher
```

##### pnpm

- **Version:** 9.14.4 or higher
- **Check:**

```bash
pnpm --version
# Should return 9.14.4 or higher
```

##### Docker & Docker Compose

- At least for the local PostgreSQL database
- **Check:**

```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
```

##### Git

- For cloning the Reference Extension
- **Check:**

```bash
git --version
```

#### Editor/IDE (Optional)

We recommend a modern code editor with TypeScript support.
Examples include:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)
- [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/)

### Required Background Knowledge

This guide targets developers with practical experience in:

- **React** - You should be familiar with hooks and components
- **TypeScript** - Basic understanding of types and interfaces
- **TanStack Start** - Understanding of the full-stack framework, including routing, server functions, and middleware
- **Docker** - Basic knowledge of working with images and containers

If any of these topics are unfamiliar, we recommend reviewing up-to-date intro material first. A solid foundation in these areas will make the rest of the guide significantly easier.

### mittwald User & Organization

#### mStudio User

To develop an Extension, you need an mStudio user account.

- **No account yet?** Register at [studio.mittwald.de](https://studio.mittwald.de)

#### Organization in mStudio

Extensions are always developed and published in the context of an organization, so users can see who built the Extension and, if relevant, billing can be handled correctly.

- Create or select an organization in mStudio
- You need owner permissions for this organization
- The organization must have a contract partner configured

#### Project in mStudio

In addition to an organization, you also need at least one project.
If you plan to follow the [deployment step](./deploy), you should avoid a project plan and instead book a server and create the project there, because otherwise you cannot use mStudio container hosting.

## Guide Structure

This guide is designed as a chronological sequence. Work through the steps in order:

1. [Become a Contributor](./become-contributor) - Become a Contributor in mStudio
2. [Configure Extension](./configure-extension) - Register and configure your Extension
3. [Reference Extension](./reference-extension) - Clone and start the Reference Extension locally
4. [Expose Extension](./expose-extension) - Make the Extension reachable from outside so webhooks can be received
5. [Testing in mStudio](./test-in-mstudio) - Create an Extension Instance and test in mStudio
6. [Deployment](./deploy) - Deploy your Extension
7. [Next Steps](./next-steps/introduction) - Adapt the Reference Extension to your own requirements and ideas
8. [(Optional) Publish Extension](./publish) - Publish your Extension in the marketplace
