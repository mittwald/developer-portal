## Use Other Anchor Points

The Reference Extension uses `/projects/project/menu/section/extensions/item` to appear as a menu item within a project.
However, mStudio provides additional anchor points that you can use for your Extension.

The basic anchor-point concept is:

- You can add a menu item in each menu
- You can embed a custom section on each page

Available anchor points can be viewed directly in mStudio.
For more information, see the [Frontend Development concept](../../../overview/concepts/frontend-development#anchors).

:::info Multiple Frontend Fragments
An Extension is not limited to one anchor point.
Besides your internal Extension navigation, you can embed multiple Frontend Fragments in different places in mStudio.

## flow Design System

The **flow Design System** is the UI framework behind mStudio.
It provides a broad set of React components for developing Frontend Fragments.

- **Documentation**: [mittwald.github.io/flow](https://mittwald.github.io/flow/)
- **GitHub repository**: [github.com/mittwald/flow](https://github.com/mittwald/flow)

The flow Design System includes, among others, these packages:

| Package                                  | Usage                                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `@mittwald/flow-react-components`        | React components for regular frontends             |
| `@mittwald/flow-remote-react-components` | React components for use inside Frontend Fragments |

Under [UI Patterns](https://mittwald.github.io/flow/03-patterns/anlegeprozess) and follow-up pages,
you will find common UX patterns that help you implement typical use cases.
If you follow these patterns, your Extension will not only look like mStudio,
it will also feel like it.

### Available Components

mStudio itself is fully built on flow components.
Everything possible in mStudio can also be implemented with flow components in your Extension.

Available components include categories such as:

- **Form controls** - Inputs, radio groups, checkboxes, etc.
- **Content** - Text, headings, images, etc.
- **Structure** - LayoutCards, Sections, Lists, ColumnLayouts, etc.
- **Navigation** - Tabs, links, breadcrumbs, etc.
- **Overlays** - Modals, tooltips, lightboxes, etc.
- **Data visualization** - Cartesian charts, donut charts, etc.

The [flow documentation](https://mittwald.github.io/flow/) provides docs, examples, and guidelines for all components.
You can also use the Reference Extension as orientation.

:::warning No native HTML elements
When developing Frontend Fragments, native HTML elements such as `<div>`, `<span>`, or `<button>` cannot be used,
except for a few [exceptions](../../../how-to/develop-frontend-fragment#limited-components).
Use the corresponding flow components instead.
:::

### Custom Styling

Custom CSS styling is intentionally not possible in Frontend Fragments.
Frontend Fragments should feel like a core part of mStudio.
Using flow components ensures a consistent look and feel.

Everything needed for layout design is possible through flow components.
If something does not work as expected or a component is missing,
you can share feedback in the [flow GitHub repository](https://github.com/mittwald/flow).

If flow components are not suitable for your use case, you can also build an [External Frontend](./05-external-frontend.mdx).

## Routing and Navigation

The Reference Extension uses [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start/latest) as full-stack framework,
which includes TanStack Router for routing.

Within your Extension, you can define as many routes as needed and navigate between them.
Routes are defined in `src/routes/`.

### Context Parameters

Via the Ext Bridge, you can access context information like `projectId` or `customerId`,
depending on the Extension Context.
You can use this data to adapt Extension behavior and UI.

In our [Frontend Fragment guide](../../../how-to/develop-frontend-fragment/#getconfig--useconfig-react),
we explain in detail how Ext Bridge works and which information is available.
