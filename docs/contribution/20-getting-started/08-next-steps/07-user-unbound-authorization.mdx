title: User-Unbound Authorization
---

In the previous chapters, you got to know user-bound authorization methods:
session tokens, OAuth2, and the Access Token Retrieval Key (ATReK).
All these methods have one thing in common:
every interaction with the mStudio API happens in the name of an mStudio user.

However, user-bound authorization does not fit every use case.
Consider the following scenarios:

- **Custom user management**: Your Extension implements its own user management independent of mStudio users, for example in white-label solutions.
- **Background automation**: Your Extension should execute mStudio actions automatically in the background, for example automated workflows, scheduled jobs, or notifications.

For these scenarios, mStudio provides an alternative authorization method: **Extension Instance Secrets**.

## How Extension Instance Secrets Work

mStudio sends the Extension Instance Secret through lifecycle webhooks for each Extension Instance.
The Reference Extension stores these secrets encrypted in the database.

With the Extension Instance ID and Extension Instance Secret, your Extension can request a short-lived access token.
This token authorizes the Extension to access resources in the Extension Context without a logged-in user.

Detailed information on obtaining an access token and its limitations is available under [Authenticating with the Extension Instance Secret](../../50-reference/5-api.mdx#authenticating-with-the-extension-instance-secret).
