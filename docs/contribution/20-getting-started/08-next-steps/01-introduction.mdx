title: From Reference Extension to Your Own Extension
---

## Starting Point

If you reached this point, you have already:

- registered and configured the Reference Extension in mStudio,
- started and tested it locally,
- made it publicly reachable, and
- optionally already deployed it.

That means your technical foundation is in place.
From here on, the focus is no longer getting the template running, but turning it step by step into your own Extension.

## The Reference Extension as a Template

The Reference Extension intentionally contains two kinds of code:

- **reusable infrastructure** such as authentication, error handling, webhook, and database fundamentals,
- **demo functionality** that only demonstrates how specific features can be implemented.

In the next steps, you separate those two parts, remove demo code you do not need, and extend the foundation for your own use case.

## Typical Next Steps

The following chapters are **modular**.
You do not have to go through them in a fixed order; choose based on your target architecture:

1. [Cleanup - Remove Demo Content](../cleanup)
   Remove sample features and keep only the technical foundation you want to build on.
2. [Use a Different Extension Context](../use-different-extension-context)
   Switch from project context to organization context if needed.
3. [Develop Frontend Fragments](../customize-frontend-fragment)
   Adapt UI, anchor points, and routing for your embedded mStudio interface.
4. [Implement an External Frontend](../external-frontend)
   Build an External Frontend instead of, or in addition to, Frontend Fragments when needed.
5. [Extend Backend Logic](../extend-backend)
   Extend your data model, migrations, and server functions for your domain logic.
6. [User-Unbound Authorization](../user-unbound-authorization)
   Use Extension Instance Secrets for background processes and custom user models.

If you already have a clear product idea, start with the chapter that has the biggest architectural impact.
