title: Use a Different Extension Context
---

The Reference Extension is built as a **project Extension** and is installed in a project context.
Depending on your use case, however, it may make more sense to develop an **organization Extension**.

:::warning Changing the context deletes existing Extension Instances
When changing the Extension Context, all existing Extension Instances are deleted.
After the change, you must create a new Extension Instance to continue testing.
:::

:::info Extension Context cannot be changed after verification request
The Extension Context can no longer be changed after requesting Extension verification.
If you are unsure which context is right for your Extension, check the [Guide for choosing the Extension Context](../../../how-to/choose-a-context).
The choice also determines which functionality your Extension can access.
:::

## Change the Extension Context

The Extension Context is configured in mStudio.
The process is identical to the one described in [Configure Extension](../../configure-extension#set-the-extension-context).
Choose **"Organisation"** instead of **"Projekt"**.

:::warning Webhook reachability
To allow deletion of the Extension Instance, your Extension must also process the corresponding webhook.
So if you change the context in your DEV setup, remember to start the tunnel first as described in the ["Expose Extension" guide](../../expose-extension).

If you forgot to start the tunnel, that is fine.
Webhooks are retried automatically.
An exponential backoff is used.
At most, you need to wait 10 minutes for the retry.
:::

Your Extension Instance will now be deleted, and then the Extension Context will be changed.
As soon as you can see that the Extension Instance is gone, you can create a new one.
