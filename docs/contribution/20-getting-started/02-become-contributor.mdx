title: Become a Contributor
---

Becoming a Contributor is simple.
You only need an organization, which you can create in the mStudio.
Organizations represent businesses through which billing can be handled, including billing for Extensions.
For our hosting products, this usually means invoices.
For Contributors, credits for booked Extensions are processed through the organization.

:::info Separate Organization
If you are already a regular mStudio customer,
it can be useful to create a separate organization for contribution,
to keep both business areas separate and simplify permission management.
However, this is not mandatory.
:::

To become a Contributor, you must add a contract partner to your organization.

Now click the **"Contributor werden"** button.
This will turn your organization into an unverified Contributor.

:::info Verification
To publish Extensions not only for yourself, but publicly,
you must get verified as a Contributor.

The information required for verification is described in the [Contributor Overview](../../overview/contributor).
We also cover Contributor verification in more detail in the [Publishing step](../publish).
