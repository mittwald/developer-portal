title: (Optional) Publish Extension
---

To publish an Extension, both the **Contributor** and the **Extension** must be verified.
To do this, some information must first be provided in mStudio.

## Contributor

The Contributor is shown to customers as the **provider** of an Extension.
The Contributor acts as **contact for questions** and as the **contract partner**.
Even for free Extensions, the customer enters into a contract with the Contributor.
mittwald only provides the **platform** for Extensions. Contracts for usage are made directly between customer and Contributor.

By default, some Contributor information is taken from the **organization's contract partner**:

- **Master data**: Information about the natural or legal person entering into the contract.
- **Support information**: Contact details for support purposes, also inherited from the organization.

You can adjust this information in the Contributor menu under **"Details"**.

### Short Description and Avatar

We recommend adding a **short description** and an **avatar** to present yourself as a provider.
This strengthens trust for potential customers.
Both are optional.

### Support Information

Customers of an Extension are shown **contact details** for support and issue reports.
These include an **email address** (required) and a **phone number** (optional).

If no custom details are configured in Contributor details,
contact data from the organization's contract partner is used.
In that case, changes in the organization also affect shown support data.
Once custom support information is configured, it remains independent of organization changes.

### Provider Identification

Any Contributor requesting verification must provide a **provider identification according to §5 DDG**,
to comply with legal information obligations for digital services.
This can be done either as a **link to an existing imprint** or as **plain text**.

With [Dieter macht den Datenschutz](https://studio.mittwald.de/app/marketplace/marketplace/62cfdf0b-9e64-4d48-ae3d-dfa3ba433df4),
there is an Extension in our marketplace that can generate legally compliant legal notice text.

### Stripe Onboarding

Billing for paid Extensions is handled via **Stripe**.
If you want to offer a **paid Extension** in the marketplace,
you must complete **Stripe onboarding** at this stage.

By completing Stripe onboarding, you agree that your Contributor data is **transferred** to Stripe.

This step is **not required** for verification if you only offer **free Extensions** and can be completed later.

### Request Verification

After all information is provided, you can request **verification** in the Contributor overview (**"Übersicht"**).
We review your information and may contact you for questions.
We want to fill the marketplace with Extensions from trusted Contributors.

## Extension

Once you are verified as a Contributor, you can request **verification of your Extension**.
Before that, you need to provide Extension details.

### Extension Name

You already assigned a name when registering your Extension,
but you can change it at any time.
Before publishing, it is a good moment to refine the name.
It should describe your Extension's purpose clearly and be unique.
Two Extensions cannot have the same name.

### Subtitle

In marketplace listings, a **subtitle** is shown below each Extension name.
This is useful because many Extensions use product names that do not immediately show what they do.

### Short Description

In the short description, explain in up to **300 characters** which problem your Extension solves.
It should quickly convey the feature scope and help users decide whether it fits their use case.

### Detailed Description

The detailed description lets you provide a rich **Markdown** description of your product,
its capabilities, and optionally a changelog.

### Logo and Additional Media

The **logo** is shown in marketplace overviews and is therefore recommended
to stand out among other Extensions.

You can also upload **additional media**
to show features and look & feel.
Currently supported formats are **JPG, PNG, and WEBP**.

### Pricing Plan

If you want to offer your Extension (partly) as **paid**,
you must complete **Stripe onboarding** first.
See [Stripe onboarding](./#stripe-onboarding) if you have not done this yet.

Once onboarding is completed and you are verified as a Contributor,
you can create either a **fixed price** or a **pricing plan with multiple Variants**.

In a pricing plan, each Variant has a `key`, which is also delivered via
**session token context information** and **lifecycle webhooks**.
This allows feature sets or limits to be adjusted based on the Variant selected by the customer.

We explain pricing in detail in the [Extension pricing overview](../../overview/pricing).

### Verification and Publication

Once all Extension information is complete, you can request **verification by mittwald** in the Extension overview (**"Übersicht"**).
We install your Extension and check whether it is suitable for mStudio,
to prevent inappropriate content from entering the marketplace.

After successful verification, you can publish your Extension at any time.
It will then be visible to potential customers in the marketplace.
