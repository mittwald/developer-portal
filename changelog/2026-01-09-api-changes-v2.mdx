:::caution Breaking changes

This document contains changes that can under certain circumstances be considered breaking. Please review the changes carefully.

While we generally strive to avoid breaking changes in accordance with our [API stability guarantees](../../../../../docs/v2/api/stability), we occasionally might perform changes that would be considered breaking in the strictest sense of the term, but we do not consider as breaking in a practical sense. We will always provide ample notice and documentation for such changes.

## Summary


- The enum value 'readonly' has been removed from the request property 'user/accessLevel' for both the `POST` operations: `database-copy-mysql-database` and `database-create-mysql-database`. This is a breaking change.
- The `GET` operation `cronjob-get-cronjob` has had several optional properties added to its response with a '200' status: 'concurrencyPolicy', 'latestExecution/exitCode', and 'timeZone'.
- The `PATCH` operation `cronjob-update-cronjob` now includes two new optional request properties: 'concurrencyPolicy' and 'timeZone'.
- The `GET` operation `cronjob-list-executions` has had the optional property '/items/exitCode' added to its response with a '200' status.
- The `GET` operation `cronjob-get-execution` has had the optional property 'exitCode' added to its response with a '200' status.
- The `POST` operation `cronjob-abort-execution` has been removed and replaced with the deprecated operation id 'deprecated-cronjob-abort-execution'.
- The `GET` operation `cronjob-list-cronjobs` has had several optional properties added to its response with a '200' status: '/items/concurrencyPolicy', '/items/latestExecution/exitCode', and '/items/timeZone'.
- The `POST` operation `cronjob-create-cronjob` now includes two new optional request properties: 'concurrencyPolicy' and 'timeZone'.
- A new endpoint has been added for the `GET` operation `miscellaneous-list-time-zones` at the path '/v2/time-zones', which lists valid time zones.
