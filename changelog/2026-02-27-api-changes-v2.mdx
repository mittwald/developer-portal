:::caution Breaking changes

This document contains changes that can under certain circumstances be considered breaking. Please review the changes carefully.

While we generally strive to avoid breaking changes in accordance with our [API stability guarantees](../../../../../docs/v2/api/stability), we occasionally might perform changes that would be considered breaking in the strictest sense of the term, but we do not consider as breaking in a practical sense. We will always provide ample notice and documentation for such changes.

## Client package releases


### mittwald PHP SDK Release v2.1.192

The latest release of the mittwald PHP SDK, version 2.1.192, introduces several new features and improvements. A key addition is the new API endpoint for setting an update schedule for a stack, allowing users to define cron-based schedules for updates. This release also includes enhanced descriptions in API request and response schemas, providing better clarity on command, entrypoint, environment variables, and resource specifications such as CPU and memory limits.

Documentation has been improved to offer clearer guidance on expected formats and examples, aiding developers in API integration. New methods, such as `setStackUpdateSchedule`, have been added to the `ContainerClient` interface, and various response classes have been created for error handling in this method.

Schema updates include detailed descriptions for resource specifications and new fields in the `StackResponse` schema to support scheduling updates. Additionally, consistency improvements have been made in request schemas for better semantic understanding.
