## Summary


- The optional properties `/items/profile/first_name` and `/items/profile/last_name` have been removed from the response with the '200' status for the following operations:
  - `GET /v2/customers/{customerId}/orders`
  - `GET /v2/orders`
  - `GET /v2/orders/{orderId}`
  - `GET /v2/projects/{projectId}/orders`

- The optional properties `/items/profile/firstName` and `/items/profile/lastName` have been added to the response with the '200' status for the following operations:
  - `GET /v2/customers/{customerId}/orders`
  - `GET /v2/orders`
  - `GET /v2/orders/{orderId}`
  - `GET /v2/projects/{projectId}/orders`

- The new optional request property `orderData/oneOf[#/components/schemas/de.mittwald.v1.order.ProjectHostingOrder]/recommendationCode` has been added to the `POST /v2/orders` operation.

- The new optional request property `orderData/oneOf[#/components/schemas/de.mittwald.v1.order.ServerOrder]/recommendationCode` has also been added to the `POST /v2/orders` operation.

- A breaking change has occurred due to the removal of the optional properties `/items/profile/first_name` and `/items/profile/last_name` from the response for the operations listed above.

_Disclaimer: This summary is AI-generated. If you find any discrepancies, please refer to the detailed changes below._

### Developer's note

Even if these changes appear to be breaking, the response of the above-mentioned Order routes does not actually change. `first_name` and `last_name` were incorrectly named in the generated spec, because technically `firstName` and `lastName` were already returned beforehand.
