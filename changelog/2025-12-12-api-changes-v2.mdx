:::caution Breaking changes

This document contains changes that can under certain circumstances be considered breaking. Please review the changes carefully.

While we generally strive to avoid breaking changes in accordance with our [API stability guarantees](../../../../../docs/v2/api/stability), we occasionally might perform changes that would be considered breaking in the strictest sense of the term, but we do not consider as breaking in a practical sense. We will always provide ample notice and documentation for such changes.

## Client package releases


### Release Summary: mittwald PHP SDK v2.1.163

The latest release of the mittwald PHP SDK, version [v2.1.163](https://github.com/mittwald/api-client-php/releases/tag/v2.1.163), introduces significant updates to request limit handling and serialization processes.

#### Key Changes:

- **Request Limit Handling**: 
  - The `limit` attribute in request classes such as `ListAppinstallationsRequest`, `ListAppinstallationsForUserRequest`, and `ListSystemsoftwaresRequest` is now optional. It has been changed from an `int` with a default of `1000` to a nullable `int` without a default value.
  - A new method, `withoutLimit()`, has been added to these request classes, allowing users to configure requests without a limit, thus providing greater flexibility.

- **Serialization Adjustments**:
  - The serialization logic has been updated to include the limit in the output only if it is set, avoiding the unnecessary inclusion of a default value.

These enhancements improve the adaptability and flexibility of the API, allowing for better management of request parameters and accommodating various use cases without imposing a rigid structure on the limit parameter.
