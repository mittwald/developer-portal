  - `CreateProjectRequest.serverId`
  - `DeleteProjectAvatarRequest.projectId`
  - `DeleteServerAvatarRequest.serverId`
  - `GetProjectRequest.projectId`
  - `RequestProjectAvatarUploadRequest.projectId`
  - `RequestServerAvatarUploadRequest.serverId`
  - `UpdateProjectDescriptionRequest.projectId`
  - `UpdateServerDescriptionRequest.serverId`
  - `ProjectFileSystemGetDiskUsageRequest.projectId`
  - `ProjectFileSystemGetFileContentRequest.projectId`
  - `ProjectFileSystemListFilesRequest.projectId`

##### Project Schema Update

- The `deletionRequested` property has been added, allowing clients to check if a project deletion has been requested.

##### Constructor and Method Updates

- The Project class now includes methods to manage the `deletionRequested` property:
  - `getDeletionRequested()`: Retrieves the current value.
  - `withDeletionRequested(bool $deletionRequested)`: Sets the value.
  - `withoutDeletionRequested()`: Removes the flag.

- The `format` property for `uuid` has been removed from several request schemas within the `Backup` and `Database` clients, including:
  - `CreateProjectBackupRequest`
  - `CreateProjectBackupExportRequest`
  - `CreateProjectBackupScheduleRequest`
  - Other related database operations handling client requests.

#### New Endpoints

#### Changes

- **Extension Update Requests**:

  - `ExtensionUpdateExtensionInstanceContractRequest`: Introduces a new `variantKey` property, essential for extensions with multiple variants.
  - `ExtensionUpdateExtensionPricingRequest`: Updated to support two alternative request bodies for specifying a price in cents or selecting a price plan, with added validations.

- **Responses**:

  - `ExtensionUpdateExtensionPricingOKResponse`: Includes a new `nextPossiblePriceChange` property to indicate the next valid time for price changes.

- **Data Models**:

  - New classes such as `PricePlan`, `Variant`, and `VariantDescriptionChangeType` have been introduced to handle price plans and variant descriptions.
